* Presented at the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control 2018, Miami
* MATLAB code for learning algorithm, demonstration and Monte Carlo simulation

### Details

* `demo.m` is a script that contains a single demonstration
* `mc_sim.m` is a script that runs a Monte-Carlo simulation of 1000 demonstrations
* `pref_learn.m` is a function that performs the preference learning (2D example)
* `pred_GP.m` is a function that makes predictions on the learned utility function

### Dependencies

* Developed in MATLAB R2017a
* Required toolboxes:
  * Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
  * Optimization Toolbox
